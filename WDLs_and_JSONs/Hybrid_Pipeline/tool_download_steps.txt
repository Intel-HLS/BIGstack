To ensure we use non-dockerized tools, but still keep up with the exact versions released by Broad for their best practices workflow, we download the tools from the docker image to our shared file system. 

Run the command: 
docker run -v /path/to/shared_filesystem:/path/to/shared_filesystem -it broadinstitute/genomes-in-the-cloud:2.3.1-1504795437 /bin/bash

This command will pull the docker image (if it is not already there locally), and put you within the container from where you can copy the tools needed for the workflow. 

root@54754360159e:/usr/gitc# cp -r /usr/local/bin/samtools gatk4 bwa picard.jar /path/to/shared_filesystem
root@54754360159e:/usr/gitc# exit

In addition to above, the Hybrid workflow uses the latest optimized GATK3.8 jar with AVX-512 optimizations and other optimizations which can be obtained from GATK website. 

Lastly, Hybrid workflow also needs a tool called "VerifyBamID" that can be downloaded as follows: 

* If on Centos, you will need to do a `yum install curl-devel` before proceeding. 
cd /path/to/shared_filesystem
wget https://github.com/Griffan/VerifyBamID/archive/c8a66425c312e5f8be46ab0c41f8d7a1942b6e16.zip && \
