# Intel® Select Solutions for Genomics Analytics

[Intel® Select Solutions for Genomics Analytics](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/select-solutions-for-genomics-analytics-brief-v2.pdf)
is an end-to-end, optimized hardware and software solution for analyzing 
genomic data. It provides a way to run pre-packaged, optimized workflows, including the Genome Analysis Toolkit* 
(GATK*) Best Practices workflows from the Broad Institute. 

This repo contains a simple smoketest benchmark for HPC clusters ("20k Throughput Run").  The test ensures your HPC system is configured correctly to run whole genome and whole exome samples.

For an overview on how to set up an HPC cluster for running GATK, see the [Broad documentation here](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035530872).  An overview of the Intel Solution, including a HW reference design, can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/solutions/select-solutions/hpc/genomics-analytics-v2.html).  

For detailed, line-by-line instructions on how to configure an HPC system for running genomics workflows, please contact your Intel representative.
