# BIGstack
The Broad-Intel Genomics Stack* (BIGstack*) is an end-to-end, 
optimized hardware and software solution for analyzing genomic 
data. It provides a way to run pre-packaged, optimized workﬂows, 
including the Genome Analysis Toolkit* (GATK*) Best Practices 
workﬂow from the Broad Institute. 

This repository WIKI has pointers to the Admin and User guides
to help setup BIGstack the way it is intended to be. 

This repository also hosts the config files needed for BIGstack 
setup, as well as a tutorial to get familiar with using BIGstack.
